1- In each program snippent, we are making an array which has the elements which are 
   multipied by 2 as compared to the
   original array. In the first function, we are providing a number n to the user which specifies the range to which the 
   elements would be multipied by 2. Like, in the first array we are specifying n as 5 so we are sending the range (0,1,2,3,4)
   so the resulting array is (0,2,4,6,8). In the second function we are looping over one more loop to double the values of the
   array. The last function is a generator function which generates the value in the same way as the the other two functions.

2- The function doubleG(n) is a generator function. A generator function is also like a 
   normal function but instead of
   a return statement it has a yield statement. The advantage of using a generator function is that the yield function will 
   pass the values to the client but will return back to the original function keeping all the values local intact.
